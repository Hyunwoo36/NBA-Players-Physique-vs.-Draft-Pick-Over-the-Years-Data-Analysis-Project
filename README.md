# NBA Players' Physique vs. Draft Pick Over the Years: Data Analysis Project
## Project Overview:
This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project exploring the relationship between NBA players' physical attributes and their draft picks over the years. The project aims to uncover trends and correlations in player heights, weights, and Body Mass Index (BMI) across different positions and how these factors might influence draft pick decisions.

## Key Components:

Data Cleaning and Preparation: Rigorous data cleaning procedures to ensure data accuracy and reliability for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): In-depth analysis to identify patterns, outliers, and key insights within the dataset.
Statistical Testing: Application of various statistical methods to examine the relationships between player positions, physical characteristics, and draft picks.
Trend Analysis: Investigation of how physical attributes of NBA players have evolved over the years and their impact on draft picks.
